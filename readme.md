#72(ish) hour frontend project

####tl;dr: Learn something new and build something cool in 3 days.

Your assignment for this 3 day weekend is to learn a new frontend library and build something cool. A big part of being a developer is being able to adapt and learn new technologies on your own. Below is a list of libraries that we think are interesting, but feel free to find something completely different (just nothing we've already learned).

##Requirements

* Use an external javascript library to create a website of your choice
* Focus on frontend
    * Make something visually interesting
    * Make something you'd be proud to show to others
* commit and push to github frequently 

Don't worry about backend for this project. Your project will probably just be a .html file and some javascript (no rails or node needed)

##Tips

- Always remember, _"good artists copy, great artists steal."_ Look at other websites and apps that you think are designed well and learn from them. Obviously don't make a direct copy, but derive inspiration from those who design well.

- Check out site websites like:
	- [adobe kuler](https://kuler.adobe.com/) - to see popular color schemes and figure out what colors go well with each other
		- while you are there, learn about the basics of [color theory](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/an-introduction-to-color-theory-for-web-designers--webdesign-1437) - it is an __essential__ skill if you want to do front-end design/development  
	- [subtlepatters](http://subtlepatterns.com/), to find cool patterns for your backgrounds  
	- [iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/) - for some good looking icons for your project
	- [behance](https://www.behance.net/search?field=102) - to see what people are designing and what the community thinks
