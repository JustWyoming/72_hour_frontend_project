troubled times, these.

somehow it seems the earth has changed form. somehow we didn't notice.

hazily, we were round, fecund, dangerous and yes luminescent. we were. we were ivy and rotting and birthing and fucking. we were.

there are those of us still who hear, those who tear the fabric back insistently. those who remember the way it used to be, who infiltrate the sleeping amongst us who siren call in whispers "remember!"

ah yes the earth... she has changed her form. now metallic fabrics and painted faces. somehow with our vast technology our revolutions, our fortitutions we didn't notice.

how can this be? globally blindsighted. and now this round fecund ball is oblong and moonshined and drifting. did we lose her? it's true she speaks only to a few. and those who speak her are heralded lunatic.

we are a peculiar breed. but there is a peeling, a desperate cloying peeling. it's global. i feel it. a cloying clamouring peeling in binary form, a peeling back of code and owed and lines towed.

i am certain it was a harpy outside my window yesterday. some deep round fecund part of me awoke before my sleepy hollows and caffeine filled limbs. that part of me woke, slipped through the ether of keys and data and instant psychic access and joined her on the boughs. it came later as a dream, or perhaps a soggy flash website... even oblong and obsolete she has not acceded defeat.

we are of the team that conjures her form.

collaborators of a dark gossamer fetal state. we wait.

we wait.

we wait...
